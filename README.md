# Problem Solving using Ruby

## Problem #1 (Find numbers)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
  Output: [0,1]
  Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
```

Example 2:
```
  Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
  Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:
```
  Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
  Output: [0,1]
```

## Problem #2 (Add Two Numbers Using Linked List)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
```
  Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
  Output: [7,0,8]
  Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

Example 2:
```
  Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
  Output: [0]
```

Example 3:
```
  Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
  Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Problem #3 (Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```
  Input: s = "abcabcbb"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:
```
  Input: s = "bbbbb"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:
```
  Input: s = "pwwkew"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
  Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Problem #4 (Palindrome Number)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
```
  Input: x = 121
  Output: true
  Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

Example 2:
```
  Input: x = -121
  Output: false
  Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Example 3:
```
  Input: x = 10
  Output: false
  Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
